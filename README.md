# worker-pool
The idea to start this project came while I was reading a book [Effective Concueency in Go](chttps://www.amazon.com/Effective-Concurrency-troubleshoot-performance-applications-ebook/dp/B0BW11N7SZ) by  Burak Serdar. I needed a hands-on exercise to practice the techniques and principles outlined in the book. 
My choice fell upon the Worker Pool pattern, since its implementation has a sufficient level of complexity that requires active use of concurrency primitives and patterns.
Important note: this is just a training project and is not intended to provide a production-ready Worker Pool implementation.
